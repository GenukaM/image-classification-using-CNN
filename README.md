# image-classification-using-CNN
In this project, we aim to showcase the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a powerful tool for image classification. We're using a dataset called CIFAR-10 as the basis for this demonstration.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes or categories. These categories include common objects like cars, airplanes, cats, and more. The goal of this project is to teach the CNN model to automatically identify and classify these diverse images into their respective categories.

To achieve this, we'll feed these images into a CNN, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for image-related tasks. The CNN leverages convolutional layers to learn intricate patterns and features within the images, enabling it to make accurate predictions about which category each image belongs to.

Ultimately, this project serves as an example of how advanced machine learning techniques, such as CNNs, can be harnessed to automate the process of image classification, a valuable application in fields like computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and many other domains.
